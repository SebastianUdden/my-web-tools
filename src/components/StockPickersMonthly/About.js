        Each meeting we agree on the amount being brought in to the common SPM
        fund by the founders, this amount will always be the same for each
        individual.
      </li>
      <li>
        The SPM fund will give 20% of the monthly profits divided equally back
        to the SPM founders, the rest of the profits will be reinvested in new
        investment opportunities.
      </li>
      <li>
        The fund will serve as a basis for a common retirement fund, helping the
        founders and their extended families for years to come.
